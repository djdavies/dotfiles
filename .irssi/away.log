01:06 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g ewhy did you use the 64bit version of ubuntu?
01:07 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g eultimately this will lead me to asking about your specs
01:07 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ebecause it sounded cool and when i looked it up it said that this comp could handle it but now i have my doubts
01:08 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ei was excited to be able to upgrade to 64 from vista 32
01:08 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g efor one, it's not an upgrade, it doesn't work like that at all
01:08 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g enow i jsut tried to do some flash game online and when it started getting hectic it crashed
01:08 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g eim learning alot of new things here
01:09 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ei was just trying to break free of windows and got excited
01:09 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g emost software is written for 32bit
01:09 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ebut i play WOW religeously and it just will not run cleanly on WINE or crossover
01:10 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ejust curious if my intel 945gm mobile chipset being run at 64 bit is to blame for the crashes and bad rendering
01:11 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ei never had amazing graphics playing on windows but its absoloutly worthless over on ubuntu, so now i have had to go back just for it... just wondered if it could all be avoided if i revert to 32 bit, i have 5 days til the discs get here...
01:11 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g ehave you dual booted?
01:12 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g ehow much ram do you have?

01:12 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g ethese are the basics i need to know
01:12 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ei did at first using the windows ubuntu boot program...i forget its name
01:12 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g ewubi

01:13 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g ethat's fine, i'll lay the cards on the table for you
01:13 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g eand trust me when i go to upgrade im getting something reccomeneded fro ubuntu 64

01:14 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g eyou can spend hours reading about the 32/64bit debate
01:14 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g every little software is written for 64-bit CPUs
01:14 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g ei spend more time reading over the ubuntu intel driver debate
01:14 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g eeven flash on firefox?
01:14 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g emost people, those who have over 4GB ram, run 64-bit people it allows the operating system to address all 4GB memory
01:14 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g efigured they be up to speed
01:15 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g eif you don't have over 4GB ram, then you don't meet the simplified "rule of thumb"
01:15 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g eah, well is it just a matter of buring the 32 bit ubuntu os iso to a disc and rebooting?
01:15 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g eyou will suffer less problems with that, yes
01:15 8/<g</YourMomsErroneoug8/>g eim sure the rule of them is complicated to explain but i think i know where you are going with this

01:18 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g eif you click on the version you're running, you'll see people contributing their knowledge
01:18 8/<gcUserX7g8/>g esaying what works, what doesn't
